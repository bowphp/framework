# Bow Event

Bow Framework's event driver system is very simple event subscription and interpage page event:

Let's show a little exemple:

```php
use Bow\Event\Event;

// Add listener on send.mail event
Event::on("email.sent", function (array $payload) {
    $name = $payload["name"];
    echo "An email was sent to $name";
});

// Emit the send.mail event
Event::emit("email.sent", ["name" => "Franck DAKIA"]);
```

NB: Is recommanded to write all event listener into simple class and define the event to the app Kernel file in boot
method.

```php
use App\Models\Activity;

use Bow\Event\EventListener;

class ActivityEvent extends EventListener
{
    /**
     * Listener method
     * 
     * @param array payload
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function process($payload)
    {
        Activity::create($payload);
    }
}
```

Into Kernel file

```php
public function events()
{
    return [
        "user.activity" => [
            ActivityEvent::class
        ]
    ]
}
```
